        <h1>The Perils of an Achievement Culture</h1>
        <p>
          An article by Ania G. Wieckowski, based on three books that tackle how
          to escape the grip of perfectionism: MoneyZen, by Manisha Thakor; The
          Perfection Trap, by Thomas Curran; and Never Enough, by Jennifer
          Breheny Wallace. <br /><br />Redacted by Anshul Choudhary

        <div class="description">
          <p class="first">
            Manisha Thakor was a self-acknowledged overachiever. From an early
            age she sought the validation of her teachers, and later, as she
            entered the working world, she strove for the approval of bosses. An
            Ivy League-educated financial analyst, she worked more hours than
            anyone else in her office, competed for the highest bonus, and often
            chose work over relationships. As she recounts in her book
            <em
              ><a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/MoneyZen-Secret-Finding-Your-Enough/dp/0063247968/"
                target="_blank"
                >MoneyZen</a
              ></em
            >, she had moments of clarity when she tried to break free from her
            obsession with achieving more. But for many years she simply
            couldn’t.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know that professional perfectionism—the feeling that no amount
            of success is ever enough—comes at a heavy cost to our well-being.
            That’s true whether the drive to achieve is intrinsic or motivated
            by external factors. In either case it’s a mindset that leads to
            workaholism, which in turn can lead to depression and anxiety.
            Divorce rates are 40% higher among workaholics than among couples
            who don’t overwork. In China’s intense “9-9-6” culture (in which
            employees work from 9 AM to 9 PM six days a week), 1,600 people work
            themselves to death every day, through heart attack or suicide. Yet
            in recent decades high-achievement cultures have only become more
            widespread, according to Thomas Curran, a psychology professor at
            the London School of Economics. In his book,
            <em
              ><a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfection-Trap-Embracing-Power-Enough/dp/1982149531"
                target="_blank"
                >The Perfection Trap</a
              ></em
            >, Curran says that perfectionism “seems to be the defining
            characteristic of our time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But over the past few years pandemic soul-searching and burnout have
            caused many people to consider scaling back. Some young people in
            China are opting out of 9-9-6 in a movement called “lying flat.” In
            Western cultures we have “quiet quitting” and “lazy girl jobs” along
            with the rise of the wellness movement. Of course, as Thakor writes,
            it’s a privilege to be able to downshift at work and still earn a
            living. But she notes that only 28% of self-diagnosed workaholics or
            overachievers toil out of financial necessity. For the rest, it’s
            important to understand what else is fueling the never-ending quest
            for more success.
          </p>

            One might assume that ego and greed are what drive high achievers.
            But in her book,
            <em
              ><a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Enough-Achievement-Culture-Toxic/dp/0593191862"
                target="_blank"
                >Never Enough</a
              ></em
            >, the journalist Jennifer Breheny Wallace instead points to “status
            anxiety” and says that it often takes root in childhood, as it did
            for Thakor, with conscious or unconscious reinforcement from
            parents. It then becomes toxic. She explains that our brains reward
            even small upticks in status—for us or our offspring—with dopamine,
            serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins, while punishing us for drops in
            status with hits of cortisol that produce stress. That’s why student
            achievement, professional perfectionism, and workaholism can feel
            like addictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thakor eventually realized that her compulsive work ethic stemmed
            from the shame she felt as a kid on the playground, where classmates
            often made fun of her mixed-race heritage, non-Anglo name, and
            physical awkwardness. In the schoolroom, however, and then the
            office, she found a safe space and a way to gain status. The
            problem, she later discovered, was that the validation she got
            through achievement had to be constantly renewed—the pursuit of
            professional success was endless.
          </p>
          <p>
            To break the cycle, she and Wallace recommend that obsessive
            overachievers find ways to reinforce the belief that they matter
            because of who they are, not what they do, and that they seek love
            and belonging, not just accolades and status. Wallace delves deep
            into the concept of “mattering,” which means that you are secure in
            meaningful connections with others and feel seen, cared for, and
            understood. People take an interest in you and what you have to say;
            they share your triumphs and support you after setbacks; they rely
            on you for guidance and help. High school students who feel that
            they truly matter to their parents—beyond doing what they’re told
            and living up to parental expectations for achievement—have higher
            self-esteem and lower rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse,
            and suicide than peers who feel they matter less.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it’s hard to shift your biology and psychology away from
            achievement addiction when the larger economy and society are
            working against you. In his examination of unhealthy perfectionism,
            Curran puts capitalist achievement culture squarely in the
            crosshairs. “Perfectionism is the defining psychology of an economic
            system that’s hell-bent on overshooting human and planetary
            thresholds,” he writes. But he reserves his harshest criticism for
            the way social media and advertising intersect to capitalize on our
            insecurities. Social platforms make money by delivering ads for
            products and services that promise to improve our status, whereas in
            fact those ads—and the posts around them—just heighten our
            anxieties. For that, he says, there is an easy fix: Stop scrolling.
            Research has found that even one hour less of social-media-based
            smartphone use a day significantly decreases symptoms of depression
            and anxiety and increases happiness and health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another modern-day element of our culture that Curran critiques is
            the glorification of the growth mindset: He argues that it forces us
            to turn every failure into a learning experience and a mechanism for
            future achievement. Espousing or buying into such thinking can put
            us in “a cage of unrelenting self-betterment,” he writes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his view, the only real and long-term solution is to shift to an
            economic model that doesn’t reward perpetual growth—for example, one
            that focuses on excellence rather than perfection, limits energy
            consumption and is thus more sustainable, reduces the wealth gap by
            establishing a universal basic income, and measures happiness
            instead of gross domestic product to inform public policy decisions
            (as New Zealand does).
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t think of myself as burdened by the achievement culture.
            Although I work hard partly because I like what I do, I also
            recognise — whether through instinct or socialization — that I feel
            the need to do a good job. I get a sense of validation when I
            succeed, followed by pressure to find my next professional win.
            Thakor’s and Wallace’s stories—and Curran’s arguments—give us a new
            perspective. I don’t want a lifetime of outperformance if it’s going
            to lead to bad relationships, burnout, and ill health. So I’m going
            to keep reminding myself that my achievements aren’t why I matter.
            <em>I hope you will do the same.</em>
