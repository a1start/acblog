        <h1>Surround Yourself with Colleagues Who Boost Your Performance</h1>

          <p class="first">
            In today‚Äôs flat and fluid organizations, building an effective
            internal network is crucial for success. Extensive research has
            shown that the networks of informal relationships that managers
            forge in the workplace influence key aspects of their performance ‚Äî
            how fast they learn, how creative they are, whether or not they‚Äôre
            staffed on high-visibility projects, and how much influence they
            garner within the organization. It also affects more tangible
            aspects of their job, such as their compensation, year-end bonuses,
            and career advancement.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to building a network, our research shows that there
            is no one-size-fits-all strategy; different kinds of people benefit
            from different kinds of networks. The key challenge, then, is to
            figure out what is the right kind of network for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help managers and organizations address this challenge, we
            conducted a two-and-a-half-year field experiment at the Italian
            subsidiary of a global semiconductor company. We were particularly
            interested in understanding whether individual cognitive styles ‚Äî a
            person‚Äôs natural or preferred approach to processing information and
            solving problems ‚Äî influenced which kind of network managers built
            within the workplace and, in turn, what impact such networks had on
            their performance.
